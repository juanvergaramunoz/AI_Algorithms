# Software Engineering - Artificial Intelligence -> juanvergaramunoz, 01/23/2019


** Project: Machine Learning Examples
** Creator: juanvergaramunoz
** Year: 2019


## Description

This Software Engineering repository includes general examples of Artificial Intelligence algorithms

The target of this project is to provide a set of Artificial Intelligence tools (still in development)


**This project has the following CLASSES:**

1) "MiniMax Algorithm - Alpha_Beta Pruning.py" has the "CustomPlayer" Class -- FUNCTIONS:
    
       - get_action(self, state, put_action)
       
       - min_val(self, state, alpha, beta, depth)


2) "Genetic Algorithm.ipynb" has the "n_queen_solver" Class -- FUNCTIONS:
    
       - __init__(self, board_size, n_pair_of_parents, n_children, mutation_factor = 100)
       
       - _initiate_parents(self)
       
       - _get_score(self, board)
       
       - _get_attacks(self, board)
       
       - select_parents(self)
       
       - create_children(self, parent_list)
       
       - mutation_step(self, board)
       
       - execute_one_generation(self)
       
       - find_best(self)
       
       - execute_algorithm(self, n_generations = 100)
